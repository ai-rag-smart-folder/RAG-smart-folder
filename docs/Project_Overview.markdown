# RAG Smart Folder - Project Overview

## What is RAG Smart Folder?
RAG Smart Folder is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based application designed for intelligent file management. It leverages AI to scan folders, detect duplicates, analyze content, and provide insights, similar to Google Photos functionality but extensible to any folder on your machine.

## Key Features
- File scanning and metadata extraction (size, type, creation date).
- Exact and near-duplicate file detection using hashing and ML.
- Image similarity analysis with machine learning.
- Safe duplicate removal with a quarantine system.
- RAG-powered content search and insights.

## Goals
- Enhance file organization and storage efficiency.
- Provide a scalable solution for personal and enterprise use.
- Support future enhancements like duplicate folder detection.

## Current Status
The project is in an initial phase with a working desktop app, FastAPI backend, and basic duplicate detection. See [Quick Start Guide](#) for setup details.
